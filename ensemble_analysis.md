# iBlend Ensemble Optimization Analysis

## Overview
The iBlend function implements a sophisticated ensemble blending mechanism with dynamic sorting and complex weighting strategies. This analysis examines the current implementation and proposes optimization strategies.

## Current iBlend Architecture Analysis

### 1. Dynamic Sorting Strategy
```python
# Key mechanism: Dynamic sorting with desc/asc combination
def alls(x, cs=cols):
    tes = {c: x[c] for c in cs}.items()
    subms_sorted = [
      t[0].replace(sls["prefix"], '')
      for t in sorted(tes,key=lambda k:k[1],reverse=True if sls["sort"]=='desc' else False)]
    return subms_sorted
```
**Analysis**: 
- Creates both ascending and descending sorted predictions
- Combines them with weighted ratios (desc/asc parameters)
- Final blend: `submission[target] = round((dfD[target] * d + a * dfA[target]),0)`

### 2. Complex Weighting Mechanism
```python
def correct(x, cs=cols, w=weights, cw=corrects):
    ic = [x['alls'].index(c) for c in short_name_cols]
    cS = [x[cols[j]] * (w[j] + cw[ic[j]]) for j in range(len(cols))]
    return sum(cS)
```
**Analysis**:
- `w[j]`: Base model weights (e.g., [0.30, 0.20, 0.50])
- `cw[ic[j]]`: Position-dependent corrections based on ranking (subwts)
- Final weight = base_weight + position_correction

### 3. Parameter Evolution Analysis
From the archived parameters, we see optimization patterns:

| Version | LB Score | desc/asc | subwts pattern | Key insight |
|---------|----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| v15 | 0.48608 | 0.40/0.60 | [+0.21, -0.02, -0.07, -0.12] | ASC preference performs better |
| v23 | 0.49423 | 0.30/0.70 | [+0.17, +0.04, -0.03, -0.07, -0.11] | Strong ASC bias with 5 models |
| v29 | TBD | 0.40/0.60 | [+0.12, -0.04, -0.08] | Reduced to 3 models |

## Performance Patterns Identified

### 1. ASC/DESC Ratio Optimization
- **Pattern**: ASC ratios of 0.60-0.70 consistently outperform 0.50
- **Reason**: Ascending order seems to capture better ranking patterns for this dataset
- **Optimal range**: desc: 0.30-0.40, asc: 0.60-0.70

### 2. Subweight Correction Strategy  
- **Pattern**: First model gets positive correction (+0.10 to +0.21)
- **Pattern**: Later models get negative corrections (-0.02 to -0.12)
- **Reason**: Rewards models that rank higher in the dynamic sort

### 3. Model Selection Evolution
- **Trend**: Reduction from 5 models to 3 models in latest versions
- **Best performers**: Models with scores 0.48507, 0.48425, 0.49343
- **Weight distribution**: Heavy weighting on best single model (0.50-0.85)

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Bayesian Optimization for Parameters
```python
def optimize_params_bayesian():
    # Parameter space
    space = {
        'desc_ratio': (0.20, 0.50),
        'asc_ratio': (0.50, 0.80), 
        'subwts_0': (0.05, 0.25),
        'subwts_1': (-0.10, 0.10),
        'subwts_2': (-0.15, 0.05),
        'weight_0': (0.10, 0.40),
        'weight_1': (0.05, 0.30), 
        'weight_2': (0.30, 0.80)
    }
    # Use gaussian process optimization
```

### 2. Advanced Ensemble Techniques

#### Meta-Learning Approach
```python
class MetaEnsemble:
    def __init__(self):
        self.meta_model = XGBRegressor()
        
    def create_meta_features(self, predictions):
        """Generate meta-features from base model predictions"""
        meta_features = []
        # Ranking statistics
        meta_features.extend(self.ranking_stats(predictions))
        # Consensus measures  
        meta_features.extend(self.consensus_metrics(predictions))
        # Diversity measures
        meta_features.extend(self.diversity_metrics(predictions))
        return meta_features
```

#### Stacking with Cross-Validation
```python
class StackingEnsemble:
    def __init__(self, base_models, meta_model):
        self.base_models = base_models
        self.meta_model = meta_model
        
    def fit_cv_stacking(self, X, y, cv=5):
        """Fit with cross-validation to prevent overfitting"""
        # Generate out-of-fold predictions
        # Train meta-model on OOF predictions
```

### 3. Dynamic Weight Adjustment
```python
class DynamicWeights:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_history = []
        
    def adaptive_weights(self, current_performance):
        """Adjust weights based on recent performance"""
        # Implement exponential moving average
        # Boost weights of recently good performers
        # Reduce weights of declining models
```

### 4. Enhanced Position-Based Weighting
```python
def enhanced_position_weighting(predictions, performance_scores):
    """More sophisticated position-based corrections"""
    # Consider model confidence scores
    # Account for prediction diversity
    # Use learned position embeddings
    position_weights = learn_position_embeddings(predictions)
    return apply_position_corrections(predictions, position_weights)
```

## Implementation Strategy

3. Test different base weight distributions

### Phase 2: Advanced Techniques

2. Stability analysis across different data splits
3. Ensemble diversity analysis
